Perfect — tool-first is the right call for this UI. Here’s a very concrete, no-nonsense prescription you can actually implement.

1. The core decision (clear + final)

Use ONE font family everywhere.
No serif. No “brand accent” font inside the product.

The clash you’re still feeling is not font choice — it’s role confusion. We fix that with a strict system.

2. Font recommendation (tool-grade)
✅ Best overall: Inter

Why:

Designed for screens + UI

Neutral enough to disappear

Strong enough weights for hierarchy

Excellent readability at small sizes

Alternatives if you want slightly different flavor:

IBM Plex Sans → more technical

Söhne / similar neo-grotesk → more premium (if licensed)

SF Pro → if you’re already system-first

I’ll describe this assuming Inter, but the system applies to any of these.

3. The real fix: a hard typographic system
Rule zero (important)

Typography communicates function, not personality, inside the tool.
Personality lives in layout, color, motion — not fonts.

4. Exact roles + settings (this is the part most teams skip)
A. Section headers

Examples:
“Your Outfit”, “Upload Your Photos”, “Add Your Garments”

Font: Inter

Weight: Medium (500)

Case: Sentence case

Letter spacing: 0

Size: ~16–18px

Line-height: ~1.3–1.4

Why: Calm authority. Not editorial. Not shouty.

B. UI labels & controls

Examples:
POSE, BACKGROUND, GARMENTS, buttons, chips

Font: Inter

Weight: Medium (500)

Case: ALL CAPS

Letter spacing: +4% to +6%

Size: slightly smaller than headers

Hard rule:
If it’s clickable or functional → it uses THIS style. No exceptions.

This alone removes 70% of the perceived clash.

C. Body / helper text

Examples:
Instructions, tips, footnotes

Font: Inter

Weight: Regular (400)

Case: Sentence case

Line-height: generous (1.5–1.6)

Why: Quiet, supportive, readable.

5. What to stop doing (this is likely the current issue)

❌ Mixing:

Title case headers + uppercase headers without meaning

Different weights for similar actions

Slight letterspacing “sometimes”

❌ Letting buttons and headings feel typographically similar

If a user has to think whether something is a label or a section — typography failed.

6. Visual hierarchy cheat check (quick test)

Blur the screen slightly and ask:

Can I instantly spot:

Section structure?

Actions?

Explanations?

If not → weights/case are too close.

7. How this aligns with your product

This tool is:

Procedural

Trust-sensitive

Outcome-driven

So the typography should say:

“This is precise. This will work. You’re in control.”

Not:

“This is stylish.”

Your current direction is almost there — it just needs discipline, not reinvention.

Bottom line

Final recommendation:

Inter (or equivalent)

One family

Three roles

Strict rules
